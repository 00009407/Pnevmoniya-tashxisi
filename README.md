README for Pnevmoniya.ipynb
===========================

Description:
------------
This file, `Pnevmoniya.ipynb`, is a Jupyter Notebook designed for Python-based analysis. It leverages GPU acceleration (T4 GPU) for computations, indicating it may involve tasks requiring significant processing power, such as deep learning or data analysis.

Key Features:
--------------
- Utilizes Python 3 as the primary programming language.
- Contains code that may involve importing libraries, data processing, and possibly training models or analyzing data.
- Designed to run in an environment that supports GPU acceleration, such as Google Colab.

Requirements:
-------------
To run this notebook, ensure the following are available:
1. Python 3.x installed.
2. Jupyter Notebook or an equivalent environment.
3. Necessary Python libraries (use the package management system `pip` to install them as specified in the notebook).

Steps to Use:
-------------
1. Open the notebook in a Jupyter-compatible environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab).
2. Ensure GPU acceleration is enabled for optimal performance if the notebook includes resource-intensive computations.
3. Execute the code cells in sequence to reproduce the analysis or results.

Note:
-----
- This README is a general guide based on the structure of the notebook. Refer to inline comments and code descriptions within the notebook for detailed instructions.
- Ensure that any external data dependencies mentioned in the notebook are correctly placed in the required directories.
